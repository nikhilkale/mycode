NUS  Mission  and  My  contribution

Today, We  all  are  living  in  a  World  where  everyone  is  becoming  Techno-savoy.  Almost  daily  some  new  technological  improvements  are  achieved  in  different  fields  of  engineering.  
On  one  side  Scientist,  Researchers, multinational  firms  are  constantly  working  on  inventions  to  make  the  world  a better  place  to  live. But  on  the  other  side  there  are  very  few  people  working  to  actually  make  sure   these  technological  advancements  are  reaching  up  to  the  widest  ranges  of  people  across the  world. 

Very  often  it  is  the  case  where  common  people  are  left  deprived  of  the  new  technology  just  because  lack  of  awareness  or  lack  of  coverage  area.  There  is  a  desperate need  of  entrepreneurs  who  will have  the  appropriate  technical  knowledge as well  as  a  management  specialization  to  bridge  this  gap. 

Business schools  around  the  globe  can  surely  guide  the  interested  candidates  to  achieve  what  they are dreaming. With  effective  combination  of  technical  knowledge  and  management  training  one  can  serve  business & society  more efficiently.  

As  an  entrepreneur,  I  wish  to  develop  new  products  which  will  reach  out  to  the  common  public  and  bring  the  new  technological  advancements  to  their  door steps. Our  focus  will  be  on  providing  products  which  will  make  day  to  day  life  easier.  Creating  technologically  advanced  yet  economically  affordable  products  will  be  a  challenge  on  its  own.

To  face  such  challenges  we  intend  to  get  ourselves  equipped  with  Technological  as  well  as Management  skills.  Traditionally  these  skills  are  acquired  through  different  institutions / courses.   
      
      PhD-MBA  course  offered  at  NUS  will be  the  best  suitable option to  develop and sharpen  Leadership skills, Resource management, Negotiation skills, Operations Management along  with  much  needed technical  expertise  . 

      I  have  worked  under  both  the  streams  of  Product Development i.e. Design / Manufacturing & Product Life-cycle Management ( PLM ). I  know  the  importance  of  correlating  the  core  technical  field  alongside  the  management  aspects. 


Post-MBA

Industrial  exposure  in  Machine  Building  Activity  in  small  companies  and  Product  Life  Cycle  Management  in  MNC  has  helped  me  to  understand  the  Importance  of  two  main  pillars  of  strength;  on  which  a  successful  Engineering  organisation  can  be  built,  namely  “TECHNOLOGY”  and  “MANAGEMENT”.

I  have  seen  that  small  Machine  building  companies  are  having  their  niche  Market, based  on  Technical  expertise, but  limited  reach;  as  they  lack  crucial  Marketing / Management  skills, which  could  expand  them  very  rapidly.

On  the  other  hand, MNC  with  structured  Organisation, well  established  Human  Resource  development  and  Marketing  experts, are  in  position  to  cater  to  Global  Markets  from  INDIA, but  lack  the  speed  of  taking  quick  decisions  like  small  organisations.

My  dream  of  starting  my  own  Design  and  Manufacturing  Company  for  making  Products  for  INDIAN / ASIAN  market  is  now  very  much  focused  with  the  thought  that  I  must  have  sound  knowledge  of  both  these  sides.  Just  Technological  skills  or  just  Management  background  will  not  be  sufficient.

With  balanced  course  structure  of  PhD-MBA  programme, giving  equal  importance  to  Technology  and  preparing  the  same  Technocrats  with  Managerial  skills  is  Ideal  for  my  goal  of  becoming  successful
 entrepreneur.  

 Time  span  of  4 ~ 5  years  devoted  to  sharpen  my  Technology  and  Managerial  skills  with  focus  on  PhD  and  MBA  stream;  can  be  utilised  to  make  solid  foundation  necessary  for  our  proposed  Start-Up  Project, utilise  the  skills  developed  to  prepare  Product  Designs  and  Business  Model

 Post-MBA, My  Elder  brother  and  myself  have  some  basic  plan  ready  for  our  Start-Up  in  Design  and  Manufacturing  Organisation; with  Singapore  and  India  locations  as  our  base  operations.
 ( my  elder  brother , who  is  currently  in  HP  Singapore;  is  MSc  in  Embedded  Systems  and  also  doing  his  MBA  in  NTU )

 Our  aim  is   to  develop  new  products  which  will  have  Design  Innovation  and  will  combine / support  current  mechatronic  Technologies  and  will  also  be  cost  effective  for  ASIAN  as  well  as  future  World  market.

 With  our  combined  strength  in  Mechanical + Electronic  fields  and  equal  base  on  Management  side  for  Finance  and  Marketing, we  are  confident  that  our  Start-Up  will  be  on  sound  footing  and  will  grow  rapidly.

 I  sincerely  hope  that  NUS  will  give  me  opportunity  for  desired  PhD-MBA  course  and  will  give  me  the  chance  to  work  with  one  of  best  University  experts  team. This  will  certainly  help  me  in  fulfilling  my  dream.
